# Voice Chat Broadcast Plugin

This is a simple Bukkit plugin that allows you to broadcast your voice with [Simple Voice Chat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat).

This project is mostly used as an example for the [Simple Voice Chat Plugin API](https://github.com/henkelmax/simple-voice-chat/blob/1.18.2/api/readme.md).

## Usage

- Have a Bukkit/Spigot/Paper server running [Simple Voice Chat](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/simple-voice-chat) 1.18.2-2.1.12 or later
- Install [this plugin](https://github.com/henkelmax/voicechat-broadcast-plugin/releases)
- Make sure you have OP permissions or the `voicechat_broadcast.broadcast` permission node
- Create and join a group called `broadcast` (Case insensitive)
- Talk in that group
- Your voice is now broadcast to every player using the voice chat mod on the server

## Compatibility

This plugin should work with every Minecraft version that works with Simple Voice Chat 1.18.2-2.1.12 or later.
